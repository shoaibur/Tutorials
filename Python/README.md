# Python: Basics
1. Difference between **is** and **==** operators
  * **==** operator checks if the contents are equal, e.g., x == y checks if the content/value of x is equal to the content/value of y.
  * **is** operator if two objects share the same memory, e.g., x is y checks if object ids of x and y are same (in the memory).
