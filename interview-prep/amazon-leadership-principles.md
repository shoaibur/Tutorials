### i. Team/time management (positive and negative)
1) Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?
* Current role - two duties.
2) Describe a long-term project you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?
* PhD project -- set goals for next 6 months -- review progress with committee members -- change as needed -- hire interns for followup experiments.
3) Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.
* Get PhD before 2020 -- motivated password 201x -- PhD 12/19 -- need to publish.
* GitHub -- no 3 consecutive days until finishing DSA nano-degree.

### ii. Adaptation
4) Tell me about a time you had to quickly adjust your work priorities to meet changing demands.
* Meeting stakeholders, 4 sections, I was working on 3rd section but started working on 1st section to meet stakeholders’ demand.
* Cultural shift from BD to US.
* From school to industry -- daily standup, sprint, so couldn't be a freelancer.
* WFH during the pandemic.

### iii. Team / decision
5) An example when you had to push back to HQ or challenged a decision.
* Current role - Fully-automated vs. semi-automated (with involvement of subject level experts)
6) Tell me about the toughest decision you have had to make in the past six months.
* Career: Facebook perception research position vs. looking for a software development (never regret like before, EE vs. CS)
* Personal: Family - stop communication with a person
7) Tell me about a decision that you regret.
* EEE vs. CS

### iv. Team/leadership

9) Tell me about a time you stepped up into a leadership role.
* Math Olympiad, led family during a crisis, , captained cricket team

### v. Team / communication and negotiation
10) Do you collaborate well?
* Yes. Current role, software development, initially alone, then involved other member, teams, companies. At least 7 teams across the globe is working together to develop it and I’m leading this.
11) Describe a situation when you negotiated with others in your organization to reach agreement.
* Current software development, showed the value, negotiated for more resources
* Meeting with stakeholders, two weeks, model I used in school, convinced team with results, convinced stakeholders in two weeks.

### vi. Team/coworkers
12) We have all had to work with people that don’t like us. How do you deal with someone that doesn’t like you?
* Listening is a good strategy; try to understand, give value and respect.
* Doesn’t like idea - present facts, data if possible.
* Doesn’t like personally - try to understand psychology, maybe twisting my personality/behavior/tone could mitigate the issues.
13) We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with colleague.
* Transition from JHU to BCM, eventually smooth, but I wish I could make it even better, specifically handed over the project to a student instead of just documenting. Given my supervisor was helping me, I could push him to hire a new student before I left.
14) The last time you had to apologize.
* To my team; couldn’t join a weekly team meeting, had go to doctor with an urgent appointment.

### vii. Team/conflict
15) Give me an example of a time you faced conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?
* Rice course project, initial discussion about a general approach, data preparation + model architecture, run models in hpc cluster; I was not happy, talked to him to understand if he did’t want to work or can’t or busy. He was busy so don’t need to do course assignment, I also implemented other models so he can tune the parameters. This approach worked well, our model became the best model.
16) Tell me about a time when received negative feedback from you manager. How did you responded?
* No official feedback at my current role; previous role: IDP - mathematics/computation poorly scored, met and discussed his reasoning; given my background, I realized his expectation was higher, specifically I could contribute in other’s projects. I understood and acted accordingly, and during introduction of thesis defense, he said that I was one of the best mathematicians he had ever seen. So, I believe my response worked out.

### viii. Problem solving
17) Tell me about a time when you missed an obvious solution to a problem.
* Renamed data files, so missing when loading.
18) A time when you faced a problem that had multiple possible solutions.
* Current role - need to deal in a regular basis, e.g. MTL
19) Tell me about a time when you came up with a new approach to a problem.
* Signal processing algorithm, slow to faster training method, design a microprocessor
20) Describe a time when you anticipated potential problems and developed preventive measures.
* Driving to Seattle, tire/tools, snow/chain, extra oil, food, pillow, blanket.
21) Describe a situation in which you found a creative way to overcome an obstacle.
* Current role - MTL, VDS model training slow to faster method.

### ix. Strategy / data
22) How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?
* Research on hand stimulation at 16 locations, fascinated but skeptical, measured output data, changed strategy to solve the same research question.
23) A time when you were 75% through a project and you had to pivot strategy.
* PhD project -- forward encoding model -- debate 5th year -- analyzed and showed how my work was out of debate.
24) Tell me about a time when you to choose between technologies for a project.
* Python vs. Matlab --> based on applicability data
* Psychophysics vs. fMRI
25) Tell me about a time you had to deal with ambiguity.

28) Provide an example of when you personally demonstrate ownership.
* Math Olympiad, US PhD to EU, JHU to BCM, DL model training

### xii. Strength
29) What’s your greatest strength?
* Keep chasing for something that I see potential, e.g. IELTS, but not forever, I understand when to stop e.g., MIT.
30) What’s your biggest weakness?
* Not well organized, so divide bigger problems into smaller ones; getting better.

### xiii. Client
31) We all deal with difficult customers from time to time. Tell me about a challenging client-facing situation and how you handled it?

### xiv. Failure
33) Tell me about a time you recovered from a difficult situation.
* Led family from a critical situation.
34) Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it.
* Current project every two months, we meet with stakeholders. Two responsibilities: (i) developing software (ii) use existing method to train the models. Shell is envisioning that the software I am developing will be the base of digital transformation in the near future, so it is highly accepted around and many teams are adopting it. So, I was enjoying and put most of my efforts on it, and occasionally worked on the second duty. Anyway, I was able to prepare some data and submitted several the model training jobs about a week before our meeting with the stakeholders. At that time, the HPC clusters were so busy, because of the nature of my job, I needed more resources than usual. So, the jobs remained pending for a couple of days and when I got the results, I didn’t have a enough time to analyze because the team needed to prepare everything by a certain time. So, after discussing with the team, we decided to remove the agenda and added the development part. But that was an embarrassment for me, because I failed in very first assignment. 

### xv. General
35) Why Amazon?
* (i) Based on simple idea - think big, invent and simplify. I dream big but like to make things simple. (ii) Customer centric, data driven, engineering + neuroscience, innovate customer engagement techs. (iii) Prime member/aws service user (iv) Immigration.

## Questions in the end
1. What are the plans for Amazon over the next 5 to 10 years and how I could contribute and be integrated to achieve the goals together?
2. Amazon always brings out new products/ideas/services. What are the next great innovation your team is focusing right now?
3. You expectedly have been working on multiple products/services, but what is the first thing you would like me to concentrate on this role?
4. Could you please one project/success that you feel proud of in this COVID-19 situation, i.e. how do the team respond to any unprecedented situation?
