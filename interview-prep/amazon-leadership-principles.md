34) Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned from it.
* Current project every two months, we meet with stakeholders. Two responsibilities: (i) developing software (ii) use existing method to train the models. Shell is envisioning that the software I am developing will be the base of digital transformation in the near future, so it is highly accepted around and many teams are adopting it. So, I was enjoying and put most of my efforts on it, and occasionally worked on the second duty. Anyway, I was able to prepare some data and submitted several the model training jobs about a week before our meeting with the stakeholders. At that time, the HPC clusters were so busy, because of the nature of my job, I needed more resources than usual. So, the jobs remained pending for a couple of days and when I got the results, I didn’t have a enough time to analyze because the team needed to prepare everything by a certain time. So, after discussing with the team, we decided to remove the agenda and added the development part. But that was an embarrassment for me, because I failed in very first assignment. 

### xv. General

* (i) Based on simple idea - think big, invent and simplify. I dream big but like to make things simple. (ii) Customer centric, data driven, engineering + neuro, innovate customer engagement techs. (iii) Prime member/aws service user (iv) Immigration.
